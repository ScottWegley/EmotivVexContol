# VexAutonomousControl
Similar to my work in https://github.com/ScottWegley/VexLiveOperation/tree/main, this project was really to gain experience working with other people's code through robotics, a topic which I was already familiar with.  The Live Operation code was cool, but relatively basic
in terms of complexity.  I'm significantly more proud of this code, not necessarily due to it's complexity though.  Rather I feel I adhered to standard design principles with this project which unsuprisingly resulted in it being easier to work with and use.  The Packet wrapper 
and Logging tool are identical between this repository and Live Operation.  The scheduler is the first time I've done anyting actually interesting with threads outside of guided class exercise.  While it could undoubtedly be improved, I am proud of it especially for my skill
level at the time.
